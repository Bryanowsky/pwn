PWN coding exercises 

You could find two folders, one by each problem in the coding problem that I recieve from PWN. 

### Exercise 1
The important file is the `time_execution.py`, this script solves the first challenge. You could execute this code with something like

`python time_execution.py asteroid_colission.py`

The other python files are just examples to test the `time_execution` script. 

**Important: You need to have python3 to execute this code.**

### Exercise 2 
In the `solution.md` file I explained how I solved the second problem.
